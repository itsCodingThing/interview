Hi, I’m Bhanu, and I’m a full-stack developer with a little over 3 years of experience, mainly working with React.js, Node.js, and TypeScript.
I’ve worked across both product-based startups and freelance projects, which has given me exposure to building systems end-to-end.

In my previous full-time role at a startup, I was the backend lead, responsible for designing and developing scalable and maintainable APIs for their ed-tech platform. Since the company was in an early stage when I joined, I contributed heavily to shaping their architecture, building multiple backend services and some frontend features as well.
I also worked with a range of AWS and Google Cloud services and set up their CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to streamline deployments.

I worked there for almost 2 years. Due to my father’s medical situation, I had to transition out of the full-time role, but I continued supporting the team for another 5–6 months on a contract basis to ensure a smooth handover.

After that, I moved into full-time freelancing, where I spent about a year working on various projects—mainly React, Node, TypeScript, and API-driven applications.
Now, I’m looking for a full-time opportunity again where I can contribute to impactful projects and continue growing as a developer.
